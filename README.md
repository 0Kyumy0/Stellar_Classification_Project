# Stellar_Classification_Project
 In this project, I built a classification model for a dataset where, based on several characteristics of stellar objects, it is necessary to classify whether it is a galaxy, a star, or a quasar. This is my second project for the Coding Dojo Bootcamp for Data Science.
