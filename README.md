# Stellar_Classification_Project
I developed a classification model for a dataset aiming to classify stellar objects into three categories: galaxies, stars, or quasars. The classification is based on various characteristics of these objects. This project is part of my second project assignment for the Coding Dojo Bootcamp in Data Science. 

The data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17

Models used:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Bagging Tree
* Random Forest
* KNN
* Logistic Regresion
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost -> the best model that fulfills the objective of this project

This conclusion was primarily reached by considering the accuracy score as well as the confusion matrix. XGBoost achieved a favorable accuracy score of 98.024%, which was the highest among all the models used. In the confusion matrix, it had the lowest number of false positives and false negatives, resulting in a higher number of correct predictions for all three classes.
