# Stellar_Classification_Project
In this project, I developed a classification model for a dataset aiming to classify stellar objects into three categories: galaxies, stars, or quasars. The classification is based on various characteristics of these objects. This project is part of my second project assignment for the Coding Dojo Bootcamp in Data Science. 

The data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17

**Summary:**  I conducted an extensive analysis by implementing multiple classification models. To evaluate the performance of each model, I utilized accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report as key evaluation metrics. By employing these metrics, I aimed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of each model in accurately predicting the classes of stellar objects. Overall, this project served as an opportunity for me to showcase my expertise in classification modeling and demonstrate my ability to utilize evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

Models used:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Bagging Tree
* Random Forest
* KNN
* Logistic Regresion
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost


I determined that the best model that fulfills the objective of this project is **XGBoost**.

This conclusion was primarily reached by considering the accuracy score as well as the confusion matrix. XGBoost achieved a favorable accuracy score of 98.024%, which was the highest among all the models used. In the confusion matrix, it had the lowest number of false positives and false negatives, resulting in a higher number of correct predictions for all three classes.
